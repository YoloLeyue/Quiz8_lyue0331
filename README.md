### This code technique forming an ASCII art-like representation of the image:[example project Link](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/LNBpdYQHP) 

1. #### *Turn the image into characters*:
##### **First**, obtain the pixels of the image. 
##### **Second**, ensure the color and position of every pixel related to a specific character.
2. #### *Create Moving Characters*:
##### **First**, initialize the index of every character to track its position in the text. 
##### **Second**, increase the index of the characters in a loop.
3. #### *Control the Speed of Motion*:
##### Initialize the rate with frameRate() to ensure the characters move at a stable speed.
